    <h2>BACON</h2>
    <p>A primitive species of the Varcite genus that is part of the Hadon family. Varcites are the parasites that roam the world of Anamnesis for food, attention, or out of boredom. They have no carnal desires, just to survive. This species in particular, Dentima, is the evolutionary ancestor to many. Their distinctive large mouth crammed with misaligned but sharp teeth point to their lower status as they still need nourishment from flesh whereas the further evolved species no longer rely on such rudimentary notions. Dentima attacks anything in their way, regardless of if it’s edible or not. They tend to prey on lower family groups such as Anthit or other Varcites, but can also feast on weaker Iom or Xansa.</p>

    <h2>HUNGER</h2>
    <p>A Heliahex from the family of Hinhgi. Hinhgi are geometric specimens that are considered to be mediators. They are neither good nor bad - the truest neutral of Anamnesis. The species Helixahex tend to be a bit mischievous, although never really nefarious. They enjoy a bit of mischief but they also know when to keep their distance. Helixahex are also one of the rare species of Hinhgi that partakes in eating flesh, even if it doesn’t provide them substantial nourishment. They just enjoy the texture.</p>

    <h2>MAMA</h2>
    <p>A species of the Giovai family. Giovai are at the top of the hierarchy in terms of the food chain, as well as in culture, society, and status. They are feared and revered, seeing as they are creators of many specimens but are also the destroyers of others. Depending on how evolved the species is, they can be neutral but others can be extremely vengeful and spiteful. This species, Protogyn, is one of the lower Giovai, seeing as they tend to be more sympathetic towards the other specimens in Anamensis. They enjoy interacting with carnivores such as Hadon and Anthit. Overtime, Protogyn delved a taste of flesh and therefore evolved a vicious mouth worth of tearing through flesh. They hunt for sport rather than for nutrients, tossing aside their catches to the lower families to feast on.</p>

    <h2>PARASITE</h2>
    <p>Culasec, the newest and most pervasive species of the Varcite family, infecting and slowly degrading their body host. Culasecs infect bodies in their singular forms and as they begin to infest the host body and slowly absorb their nutrients through their porous skin, they begin to asexually reproduce into a large, interconnected cluster. Once enough time passes, they become large enough to burst through the skin and slowly squirm their way out, slugging their way through Anamensis for their next host. More often than not though, they will manipulate their current host body to attack their next prey and then quickly transfer over to their next home to once again reproduce.</p>
