<h2>QUYNH PHAM</h2>
<h3> SHE/THEY | VIETNAMESE</h3>

<p>Thank you for looking at my work! I am a Junior Graphic Design major at the College of Design at the University of Minnesota. As an avid home cook & baker, I have always had a passion for the culinary arts. When not in the kitchen, I love bringing my love of food to my graphic designs. I specialize in food designs such as packaging, marketing, paper or video advertisements, magazine/cookbook layouts, website layouts, logo creation, etc.</p>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

<p>Because of my illustration background, I also do freelance artwork for various clients. I love making dark and wicked art in various mediums, packed to the brim with suffocating detail. My art is heavily inspired by the genres of music I like to listen to, mostly metal and rock. That's why I am also an exteremly maximalist designer - I love filling up space with meaningful designs and overexposing the viewerâ€™s senses with color and detail!</p>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

<p>I am a large advocate for community-based designs and work that not only serves a functional purpose but also serves an emotional significance to my communities. Good graphic design should not be inaccessible to those with few resources - everybody deserves to have their story told respectfully & beautifully!</p>
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

<p>I'd love to talk more about my purpose/interests & would love to hear yours! Let's connect & talk!</p>
