    <h2>RAPTURE</h2>
    <p>A chimera species, named Embrynisk, from families Bora & Anthit getting destroyed due to its birth defects. Different families are generally not bred together due to many Giovai believing in family purity, but some stray creators like to meddle with the limits of biology. Giovai are lovers of mutilated and indiscernible forms, however, when a specimen is born with nothing to provide or somehow gain any form of sentient intelligence, they are quickly destroyed so that they do not affect the gene pool. In this scene, an Embrynisk was born with intelligence beyond its own mental fortitude, leading it to question its existence and therefore their creators. This consciousness terrified the higher powers to which they sought to destroy, leaving behind nothing more but a new but extremely dumb embryo in place of the Embrynisk.</p>

    <h2>NOWHERE & ANYWHERE</h2>
    <p>A depiction of one of the E.N.Viro, or what we humans may know as cities, in Anamensis. Most if not all E.N.Viro locations are violent and bursting with life as well as death. Specimens maul each other to death, eliciting loud, shrieking sounds of pain that echo throughout. E.N.Viro are mostly populated by middle class families such as Bora and Xom. Lower class families like Anthit would be instantly killed on sight if they were to ever enter these spaces. The true location of this particular E.N.Viro is unknown but its structure is very similar to others of its kind.  Developing specimens or work in progress species are kept in glass cases, in very high buildings so that the Giovai can observe them from their elevated living grounds. Many families and species inhabit this space, but it appears that this E.N.Viro has been infested by Iilps. The location must also be near a water source that overflooded, leading to water logged structures. This depiction is also one of the first times a Culasec is seen, itâ€™s development still infantile but extremely virile.</p>
